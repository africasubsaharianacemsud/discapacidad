The project’s goal is to compare conditions for disabled students in Mexico and South Africa, specifically between the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits).\n\n\nnHere you will find materials from our disability seminar entitled ‘Mexico and South Africa: A multidisciplinary approach to disability’ dedicated to showcasing disability-inclusive improvements in university facilities and their educational processes."

        "text": "Apartheid South Africa was marked not only by political struggles but social activism too. One focused on securing recognition of the disabled. Since then, the South African government has created specialised departments to ensure respect for the human rights of minorities, including people with disabilities. The mission, however, is far from over.\n\n\nWits University’s outstanding Disability Rights Unit (DRU) is responsible for supporting students with disabilities in both academic and non-academic activities, and runs a constant information campaign about the difficulties disabled students encounter in order to raise awareness, both within and without the university."

In Mexico, disability is also a relevant issue that concerns the government, as evinced in the Political Constitution of the United States of Mexico, in its articles 1 (No discrimination), and 4 (economic support for disabled people by law).\n\n\nUNAM, as Mexico’s most prestigious academic institution, finds itself obliged to seek means of improving the access of the disabled to a quality education, of fostering inclusion, and of ensuring the human rights of all students."
