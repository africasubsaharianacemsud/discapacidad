        "content": "Frida Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954 in Coyoacán, Mexico City. Her full name was Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo Calderón.\n\nShe studied at the German School and the National Preparatory School in Mexico City. In 1925, she suffered a tragic accident, the consequences of which endured until her death. During a long convalescence, Frida began to paint her face by copying it from a mirror mounted on the canopy of her bed. At first, she was a realist and painted portraits of family and friends, and also flowers. Later, though, because of the intensity of her feelings and her shattered body, she increasingly painted herself in dreamlike, sometimes brutal contexts. Some of her work has even been associated with surrealist tendencies because of its introspective character.\n\nIn 1929, she married Diego Rivera, whom she divorced in 1940 and remarried a year later. She taught painting at the Escuela de Artes Plasticas and was a member of the Seminary of Mexican Culture. In 1938, she mounted her first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. Her works were included in the 1939 \"Mexique\" Exhibition, presented at the Renou et Colle Gallery in Paris, as well as in other group shows presented in Mexico throughout her life.\n\nShe participated in the International Exhibition of Surrealism organised in 1940 at the Gallery of Modern Art in Mexico City. Important institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris house some of her works."

        "content": "Leon Botha was born in Cape Town, South Africa where he lived until his death. He was diagnosed with progeria at the age of 4. While he had no formal education in the arts, after graduating, he became a full time painter doing commissioned work.\n\nIn 2005, he successfully underwent surgery to prevent heart attacks due to progeria-related atherosclerosis.\n\nIn January 2007, Botha held his first exhibition entitled \"Liquid Sword; I am HipHop\". It portrayed Hip Hop culture as a way of life and was opened by Mr Fat of the South African Hip Hop group Brasse Vannie Kaap.\n\nIn March 2009, he opened his second exhibition featuring aspects of his life. When asked if the title ‘Liquid Swords; Slices of Lemon’ referred to the saying ‘If life gives you lemons, make lemonade’, Botha denied it, adding ‘Lemons? I slice them and serve them.’\n\nIn January 2010 he held the first exhibition of ‘Who Am I?... Transgressions’, a collaborative photography work with Gordon Clark at the João Ferreira Gallery in Cape Town. About the exhibition, Botha stated ‘First I am, like you, a spiritual being. Then I am a human being and this part of the human being, which is the body, has a condition.’\n\nBotha also practised deejaying and toasting under the name DJ Solarize. He was featured alongside Watkin Tudor Jones (also known as Ninja), in Die Antwoord's Enter The Ninja video.\n\nIn November 2010, Botha suffered a stroke. He died of cardiac arrest a day after his 26th birthday, in 2011."

The mission, however, is far from over. Wits University’s outstanding Disability Rights Unit (DRU) is responsible for supporting students with disabilities in both academic and non-academic activities and runs a constant information campaign about the difficulties disabled students encounter in order to raise awareness, both within and without the university."
